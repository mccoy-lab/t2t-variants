Code associated with the manuscript "A complete reference genome improves analysis of human genetic variation". This repository contains downstream analysis code used in various population genetic analyses by the McCoy lab, organized into directories described below:

`haplotype_structure` - investigation of LD-discordant alleles (i.e., alleles in negative linkage disequilibrium) which may arise in GRCh38 by consequence of it's construction with BAC clone libraries derived from multiple donors.

`local_ancestry` - superpopulation-level local ancestry inference for GRCh38 and CHM13 in comparison to reference haplotypes from the 1000 Genomes Project.
