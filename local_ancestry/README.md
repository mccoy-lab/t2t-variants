`CHM13` - local ancestry for CHM13 inferred by [rfmix](https://github.com/slowkoni/rfmix).
`GRCh38` - local ancestry for GRCh38 clones inferred through comparison to individuals from the 1000 Genomes Project.

`introgression` - identifying Neanderthal-introgressed haplotypes in GRCh38 and CHM13 with [IBDmix](https://github.com/PrincetonUniversity/IBDmix), using the 1000 Genomes populations and Vindija Neanderthal as references.
